## About
![./images/screenshot.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/markdumay/hugo-theme-vanity/main/images/screenshot.png)

- [Online Demo][demo]
- [Example Site Source][example_site]

Go uses URLs such as `github.com/uber-go/atomic` to import packages. This import statement links directly to the repository hosted on `github.com`. Go supports [vanity import paths][golang_remote_path] to decouple the import path and the code repository. For example, the `atomic` package is made available at `go.uber.org/atomic`, which redirects to GitHub under the hood.

Inspired by the [Uber Go][uber_go_url] landing page, this repository simplifies the creation and maintenance of a website to list and resolve the packages using a vanity base url (e.g. `example.com`). The repository is implemented as a theme called `go-vanity` for [Hugo][hugo_url]. The generated static site can be deployed on any capable host. The next sections describe the prerequisites, installation, and configuration of a vanity site.

## Prerequisites
The following prerequisites need to be met in order to use the `go-vanity` theme correctly.
- **A (local) machine with Hugo and Git installed** - Hugo is needed to test the configuration and to generate the static site. The [quickstart][hugo_quickstart] describes the key steps how to get Hugo, including Git, up and running.
- **A web host is required** - A web host is required to host the landing page and the related content generated by Hugo. The [about section][hugo_about] of Hugo displays a list of popular hosting providers.
- **A registered domain name is required** - A domain name (such as `example.com`) is required to be used as basis for the vanity url. The DNS should point to your web host.


## Installation
The `go-vanity` theme can be installed as a regular Hugo theme. Run the following command from within the main directory of your Hugo site.

```console
$ git submodule add https://github.com/markdumay/hugo-theme-vanity.git themes/go-vanity
```

## Configuration
Once installed, apply the `go-vanity` theme to your main Hugo site in its `config.toml`. The `baseURL` is used as the base path for your vanity URL. The landing page will display a default paginator if `paginate` is set in the main configuration. Additionally, a copyright notice is added to the landing page's footer when specified.

The theme uses one parameter: `redirect`. When `redirect` is set to `false`, individual package URLs will not redirect automatically. This allows you to test the settings and to inspect the generated HTML code. 

```toml
baseURL = "http://example.com/"
languageCode = "en-us"
title = "example.go"
theme = "go-vanity"
copyright = "Copyright © 2021 Author Name; all rights reserved."
paginate = 5
[params]
    redirect = true
```

Each package you wish to configure should have its own content file. This file requires two additional variables in the frontmatter: `repository` and `godoc`. The `https://` prefix for these URLs is added  automatically by the `go-vanity` theme. The configuration of `example.com/package` should be defined in `content/package.md`. Lastly, the file should include the tag `package` for the package to be rendered on the landing page.

```yaml
---
title: "package"
date: 2021-09-14T13:20:55+02:00
draft: false
repository: github.com/owner/repo
godoc: pkg.go.dev/example.com/package
tags: [package]
---
```

## Usage
Once configured, run or deploy your Hugo site as usual. When running locally, the landing page is available at `localhost:1313`. The URL `localhost:1313/package` will redirect to `github.com/owner/repo`. When deployed in production, the URLs will change to `example.com` and `example.com/package` respectively.

> When running locally, `hugo server -b http://example.com` replaces `localhost:1313` with `example.com`. This allows you to visually verify the rendering of the pages. This may lead to server binding errors though.

As mentioned in the previous section, setting `redirect` to `false` in the `config.toml` allows you to inspect the generated code for each package.
